You are building a sleek, professional, tech-themed website for me. I want you to implement high-end, scroll-driven animations inspired by the style and feel of the animations on https://www.arcium.com/
.

Animation Style & Goals

Make the site feel premium, modern, and tech-focused.

Animations should be smooth, subtle, and purposeful, not flashy or gimmicky.

Use the entire screen, not just text boxes – sections, backgrounds, and layout elements should all participate.

The motion should support storytelling and flow as the user scrolls.

Scroll-Based Behavior

Focus on scroll-linked animations, not just on-load effects.

As the user scrolls down the page:

Sections should fade/slide in with depth, possibly using light parallax so different layers move at slightly different speeds.

Key visuals (cards, diagrams, feature blocks) should animate in sequence as they enter the viewport.

Backgrounds can shift, move, or morph slightly to create a dynamic, immersive feel.

Use scroll-driven transitions between sections so the page feels continuous and well-crafted.

Elements to Animate (Beyond Text)

Hero section (above the fold):

Full-screen animations that feel techy: e.g. abstract shapes, grids, soft glows, flowing lines, or data-like patterns.

The heading and CTA can animate in, but the hero background and layout should also subtly animate or respond to scroll.

Content sections:

Animate cards, images, icons, and feature blocks, not just text.

Use staggered reveals so elements appear one after another as the user scrolls.

Add section transitions (e.g., smooth wipes, masked reveals, or panels sliding over each other).

Global micro-interactions:

Hover effects on buttons and links (slight scale, underline animations, glows).

Icons that animate gently on hover or when they come into view.

Visual Direction / Tech Theme

Aesthetic: modern SaaS / deep-tech.

Clean typography, dark or neutral backgrounds with subtle gradients.

Abstract shapes, grids, or data-like visuals to reinforce the tech theme.

Keep motion consistent:

Use similar easing, durations, and directions for animations across the site so it feels unified.

Performance & UX

Animations must be:

Smooth and performant on modern desktop and mobile browsers.

Non-intrusive – content should always remain readable.

Responsive – adjust or simplify animations on mobile, but keep them polished.

Avoid overloading the page; prioritize quality over quantity of effects.

Implementation Notes

Use scroll-based animation techniques (similar to GSAP ScrollTrigger or equivalent) to:

Link animation timelines to scroll position.

Stagger element entrances.

Control section transitions and background motion.

Build a cohesive animation system that applies to:

Hero

Feature sections

About/Story sections

Any call-to-action or pricing/summary sections

Final objective:
The finished website should feel sleek, professional, and unique, with scroll-driven, full-screen animations (similar in spirit to arcium.com) that maintain a strong tech theme and make the site look carefully crafted and well made.
